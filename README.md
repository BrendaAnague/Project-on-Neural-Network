# Project-on-Neural-Network (Dolphine Network)
The Dolphine Network is an undirected social network of frequent associations
between 62 dolphins in a community living off Doubtful Sound, New Zealand.
Ecologist David Lusseau of the University of Aberdeen, UK, studied the
social lives of a community of 62 bottlenose dolphins from 1994 to 2001. Each
dolphin was marked on their dorsal fins and he kept track of individual animals
via photographs.
